-add strucutre to code:
	- start glueing stuff together
	- default menu to large , 
			maybe add more table like feedback on squad composition
			feedback from coach (areas of strenth and weakness)
			a filtered squad to only show not great players.
			a menu option to show all squad
		
-need player ability to filter list
-index working seems wonky (Replacing position 23 brings an error, position 3 replaces GK rather than LB)
-get some end to end test working?
-merge in to larger test case
